# Welcome to Xelerus

A simple chatbot created with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs) and powered by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). In this chatbot you'll be talking to Xelerus, he was created with the intention to right scripts for his [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@xelerus)

## Getting Started

To setup and run Xelerus is very simple, you just need NodeJS version 16.16.0 or higher and configure the .env. To get your `OPENAI_API_KEY`, you will need to generate one on the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) (you must have an account to do that).

After is all configure just install all the dependencies and run the dev command. It's recommended to use the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to do that, but any Node package managemnt can be used.
